# TicTacToe AI Project

This is a Tic Tac Toe console game made with Java. I have given my own touch to the console game with a unique (yet simple) board. 

### How did I make it
I used a minimax algorithm to construct the basis of this game. My friend and I referred to basic minimax structure from online sources when writing this code. Therefore there are a few cases in which the computer player still does not make the right choice. It will be fixed in further updates.
